UNet trainer for SDXL models. PyQt6 GUI and CLI wrapper. Modified from [Aozora](https://github.com/Hysocs/Aozora_SDXL_Training).   

Example configs are provided. Trainer will automatically generate a default one if there are none.   

Hardware requirements:

- 12 gigabytes of VRAM
- Less if only training LoRAs

Features:    
 
- Precomputed latent caching    
- Resume state from a training checkpoint   
- UNet layer exclusion via keyword filter
- Live statistics for learning rate, gradient norms and loss
- AdamW (Raven) that offloads to CPU for less VRAM
- Gradient centralization    
- Train LoRAs and LoCons    
- Tag caption dropout with wildcards
- Flow matching scheduler  
- More timestep sampling choices  
- Reflection padding for EQ-VAE
- Neutral light theme  
- More utility scripts    

Usage:

`git clone https://github.com/geltz/sdxl-trainer`  
`python -m venv venv` or use uv: `uv venv venv`    
`./venv/scripts/activate`    
`pip install -r requirements.txt` or use uv here    
`python gui.py`    

Headless:  

`python cli.py configname`

This runs a `.json` generated by `gui.py` by wrapping into `train.py`.
